# Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)-
It is a process of recognizing information units like names, including person, organization and location names, and numeric expressions including time,
date, money and percent expressions from unstructured text. The goal is to develop practical and domain-independent techniques in order to detect named entities with high accuracy automatically.
The data here is a clinical prescription. It is a feature engineered corpus annotated with POS tags and every word is tagged with appropriate entities on which CRFs are applied which is often used for labeling or parsing of sequential data, such as natural language processing and CRFs find applications in POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, among others. Hence, by training CRF model for named entity recognition on our dataset, we are showing the topmost features that determine whether a word is
belonging to that particular entity or not and how the tagging of the word either is affected or enhanced by those features useful for determination
